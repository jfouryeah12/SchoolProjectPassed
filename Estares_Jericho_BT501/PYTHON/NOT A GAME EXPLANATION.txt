NOT A GAME is a retro game developed by me. 
It's is based on Pokemon Gold and Silver in battle from 1999. 
Now the NOT A GAME is a survival game where you buy items and upgrades in the shop to increase the winning rate in the duel. 
Goblin is a common enemy in the game that is far weak and easy to kill. 
And the troll is stronger than the goblin well as it can kill you fast without you noticing. 
And in the shop to buy items, you must earn Lo. Lo is a currency used in the game and, "it can be earned" by killing goblins or trolls. 
In a duel, you had a what we called "Player Turn" Every attack you made cost 1x Player Turn, and if this hit to 0 you, can't Attack anymore, you can be earned "Turn" by resting but be aware that every round the enemy still attacking you. 
Health is vital to your fight, and if this hits 0, you will lose in battle to fix this buy health potion in the shop. 
But be aware that if you hit 0 and don't have any money to buy any potion's you are screwed.
