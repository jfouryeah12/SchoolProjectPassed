NOT A GAME is a retro game that I created.
It's based on the duel between Pokemon Gold and Silver from 1999.
The NOT A GAME is now a survival game in which you can buy equipment and upgrades in the shop to improve your dueling odds.
Goblins are a prevalent enemy in the game who are quite weak and easy to defeat.

The troll is also more powerful than the goblin, as it may kill you quickly and without your knowledge.
You must also earn Lo in order to purchase stuff in the shop. Lo is the game's currency, which may be obtained by slaying goblins or trolls.
In a duel, you had a "Player Turn." Every assault you made cost 1x Player Turn, and if this hit 0 you can no longer attack. You can earn "Turn" by resting, but be mindful that the enemy will continue to attack you every round.

If your health drops to zero, you will lose the battle. To solve this, go to the shop and buy a health potion.
However, if you reach 0 and don't have enough money to buy any potion, you're out of luck.
